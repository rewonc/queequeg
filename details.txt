12k images


Approach:

Directly optimize the loss. (Multi class logarithmic loss)

Have a baseline, and test whether things work.
- rescaling images in various ways
- global zero mean unit variance normalization
- Data augmentation - on demand
- VGGnet -- 3x3 conv filters, scale up until you see it overfitting.
- Cyclic pooling
- TTA -- augment images, then average them.
